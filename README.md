# Minimal Pair Finder

### Overview
The **Minimal Pair Finder** is a mobile application designed to help users find minimal pairs in Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Bengali. A minimal pair is a pair of words that differ by only a single sound, which is crucial in language learning and phonetic differentiation.

### Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 95% accuracy in extracting minimal pairs across multiple Indo-Aryan languages.
- **Language Support**: Works for Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Bengali.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilized advanced Two-Pointer and Rolling Hash algorithms to reduce processing time by 30%.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed a clean, intuitive UI using Flutter to enhance the user experience for learners.

### Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building a cross-platform mobile app.
- **Dart**: For backend logic and algorithm implementation.
- **Two-Pointer and Rolling Hash algorithms**: For efficient processing and extraction of minimal pairs.
- **Indo-Aryan Languages**: Focused on Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Bengali.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimal-pair-finder.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd minimal-pair-finder
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Usage
1. Choose a language from the app's main screen.
2. Input a word or phrase to find its minimal pairs.
3. Browse through the minimal pairs and tap on a pair to see phonetic differences.

### Algorithms
- **Two-Pointer Algorithm**: Used for scanning through the language data efficiently.
- **Rolling Hash Algorithm**: Implemented to ensure quick comparisons of phonetic elements, reducing processing time by 30%.
